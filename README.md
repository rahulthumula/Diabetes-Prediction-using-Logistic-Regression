# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Logistic-Regression
Diabetes Prediction Model
This project involves building a predictive model to determine the likelihood of diabetes onset in 
patients based on various health metrics such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, etc. 
The dataset used for this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database from Kaggle.

## Data Exploration and Visualization
The project starts with exploratory data analysis using Python's pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib libraries. 
We analyze the distribution of each feature, and also visualize the relationship between the target variable (diabetes onset) and other features using scatter plots.

## Data Preprocessing and Model Selection
We then preprocess the dataset by splitting it into training and testing sets, and also by normalizing the features to improve model performance. 
We select logistic regression as the model of choice, as it is a commonly used classification algorithm for binary outcomes.

## Model Training and Evaluation
We train two logistic regression models using the training dataset. The first model includes all features, while the second model uses a subset of features selected based on their statistical significance.
 We evaluate both models using the test dataset, and compare their accuracy and confusion matrices to determine which model performs better.

## Results and Conclusion
Our analysis reveals that the logistic regression model with a subset of features performs better, achieving an accuracy score of 79.2% on the test set. 
This indicates that the selected features (Pregnancies, Glucose, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, and BloodPressure) are most relevant for predicting diabetes onset.
Our model can be used to identify patients who are at a higher risk of developing diabetes, and take preventative measures to reduce the risk of complications. 
It may also help healthcare professionals to make more informed decisions when treating patients with a higher likelihood of diabetes onset.

## Future Work
In the future, we plan to explore other classification algorithms such as decision trees and random forests to compare their performance with logistic regression.
These algorithms may be more suitable for datasets with non-linear relationships between features and the target variable.
We will also investigate the use of ensemble methods such as bagging and boosting to further improve model performance.
We also aim to improve our model by incorporating additional features that may have predictive power, such as patient lifestyle habits, family history, and genetic factors.
We will also explore ways to handle missing data in the dataset, such as imputation and deletion, to ensure that our model is robust and reliable.
Furthermore, we will consider the ethical implications of using predictive models in healthcare, and ensure that our model is fair and unbiased for all patient groups. 
We will also collaborate with healthcare professionals to validate the usefulness of our model in real-world clinical settings, and obtain feedback for further improvement.
